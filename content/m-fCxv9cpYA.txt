oh oh
dude i see what's going on over here
dude
you just just reminded me of another
tune [ __ ] dude
we're here with the uh
the duke of decor
strider wilson
with the bottom
[ __ ] oh my god we're gonna be burning
some right now we might be burning dude
and we're here with the
juggernaut of jubilation
[Laughter]
yeah we're pumped up because
because we're doing a draft today we're
drafting our top four pump up songs of
all time you all ready for this and so
we've already given some away but
there's a lot to choose from it's a very
broad category
we all feel like there's gonna be less
overlap on this one than other drafts i
agree with that i agree with that and
chris you already had some beef
uh oh yeah well cause i was like
i took it to me and like um
just to try and narrow the scope of it a
little bit to be like all right so we're
talking about like
like more like like what gets you pumped
to like work out because there's a lot
of overlap between like the workout
songs like my favorite songs to rage to
right and like party so it's trying to
stay
away from those but then it seems like
these guys were
yeah you there's different things that's
why we said
exactly that's smart there's different
ways to get different things to get
pumped up but look you could build a
great list
based on your strategy and aaron might
appreciate it for what that list is yeah
the top i mean workout is probably the
biggest
category or the most potent and there is
and then overlap like i said yeah yes
yes and you know
if you [ __ ] up you [ __ ] up there's
always the next draft i'm gonna [ __ ] up
i'm gonna i [ __ ] up it's who i am
it's what i do
now today's the day you you changed that
thank you dude well you did good i mean
you crushed the last one and you didn't
bend on the last one yeah i didn't bend
exactly do you miss bending i do
did it was it hard for you to not be an
agent of chaos i miss it so bad i might
just have to bend on this one baby but
like we said really tough to bend
yeah because there's different ways to
get pumped up yeah exactly yeah it's
like yeah all right choose the
soundtrack from unforgiven and the thing
that's tough is i was discovering songs
all morning i was just going through
instagram i was like oh [ __ ] just like
this i was like dude there's another
sign the other side it's good
can i put this out there right now and
look we love these these drafts because
it gets the fodder everyone's so
passionate about it we love it
we know we're going to miss a ton and
that's like my when building a list i'm
like the fomo of missing all those sick
ass songs so yeah share them let us know
but don't dm me and go stride are you
dumb ass how could you not have said
that yeah i'll be like dude come on man
just give me some love and well then
sometimes they'll like
sometimes i get it like when there's a
huge obvious one yeah and then sometimes
the way they get at you
is even dumber than your mistake like
they'll be like
how come no one picked gus from breaking
bad i'm like hey [ __ ] because we said
movie villain yeah movie like some
people will talk [ __ ] when they haven't
even or they've like how come no one
picked anton shakur
i was like i picked him third so they
sent that after two picks
i mean come on
i mean come on
and i took some heat for this but i'm
going to say it
this is going to be a tough one guys
dude we were laughing about that dude
yeah when my
we say that every time right it's going
to be tough they're all tough they're
all tough in their own way yeah i
challenge you instagram commenter to get
into the hot seat and not sit and just
be like oh this is easy and then you try
and bend and then you're stuck with your
dick in your ass dude we're sensitive
guys guys yeah like we we hear you when
you say these things we take this [ __ ]
seriously i didn't sleep last night dude
just hung out and just looked at my wall
but we are the man in the arena our face
is marred by blood sweat and internet
blue screen yep we're the ones putting
in the f
the [ __ ] dude you can cruise
all right all right let's do this
odds are evens
one
two three
oh oh i'm so sure
one two three four oh fourth pick chris
that's okay
one two three
oh third oh dude here we go i wanna go
first dude i'm going first
uh yeah roshambo paper rock scissors
shoot
jt's first do you do scissors every time
do i yeah every time we play i like that
you do that though dude i reset every
day he's got he's got a notebook of
everyone's first
he just goes daddy's awake now
[Music]
um
all right whoa dudes i did not expect to
get the first pick
holy [ __ ] all right i know what i'm
doing okay so i i broke it up into
categories different kinds of pump up i
love it and this one to me
my three main categories are
workout
uh
workout pump up workout or fight pump up
uh sex emotional pump up party pump up
and then its own category i i'll say
life heroic pump up like heroic pump up
this one
falls into the ladder group i'm going
with my hero by the foo fighters
great song dude great movie bro yeah
dude because you know what this one does
this one pumps me up it's good during a
workout
not really for partying it's good for
the emotions too but this one's like
when i'm driving on the freeway and i'm
just thinking about the whole scope of
my life and do i have the willpower to
take it on if i put on this song i
instantly get full to the full i
instantly get filled to the brim with
like the the courage to take on
whatever's in front of me and then
it's about you know
just saving people which is sick that's
all right and it looks good in a montage
which i also think is good for a pump-up
song varsity blues
beautiful sequences
and uh yeah i'm gonna go with my hero by
the foo fighters excellent pick and i
know you get pumped up to that because
you guys were moshing at a concert at
jingle ball years ago to that so i've
seen you literally
in the mosh pit
it's the drums dude
also should we just play the songs for a
second
[Music]
it oh yeah
dude yeah dude i'm fired up that works
for me
uh it's me chad well i gotta go with the
number one pick and i gotta go with you
know this is sort of a top
pump up song i'm sure it's expected
and uh this one is literally telling you
this is your moment to shine don't [ __ ]
it up
and
you know
i gotta go with it i gotta go lose
yourself by eminem yeah we've been my
number one uh it's the ultimate pump up
song this is your moment to shine this
is your moment to grab life by the balls
and take yourself to the next level this
is your one moment
to [ __ ] do it
now are you gonna do it or you're gonna
back down
and eat your mom's spaghetti
and he's weak arms is heavy there's
vomit on his sweater all right mom
spaghetti he's nervous
dude it's so good yeah the vitality i
mean calm and ready you can feel
eminem's whole life in it when he's
talking about it yeah
and i do i mean
at the oscars when he did it a few years
ago that was incredible it just blew me
away seeing that live so
and i've never seen eminem live i really
want to see him live have you guys seen
him live no dude i love that yeah very
raw song
yeah so that's gotta be my number one
[ __ ]
that's so [ __ ] good dude i wonder
though if hamilton's my shot is stronger
oh bro that's a great song dude
i am not throwing away my
that's kind of based on the eight miles
song right probably like he totally kind
of lifted he was from that yeah he was
listening to a lot of eminem i think so
it's a good call
for sure hey the good ones borrow the
great ones deal
but the words won't come out he's
choking how everybody's joking now the
clocks run out time's up
snap back to reality
all right so we're all we're all fired
up because we just listen to lose
yourself now we're ready to tackle our
cameras dude exactly someone's going why
are you staring at me camera it's also
like you think about
the rap battles from eight mile you know
which it came out with you know
oh yeah and this would have been
strider's number one pick and your
number one pick chris yeah because it's
just a it's a solid number one i think
it checks so many boxes because it
checks in athletic if you have athletics
coming up it gets you pumped up for the
game with a team yeah then it also gets
you just in the zone for your own
workout yeah then you can play it like
just chris just said for a bat like
literally for a party scenario yeah like
if you're a huge version and it's
emotional it's wrong yes yeah and it
gets you horny for sex you could [ __ ]
during this song for sure dude you know
and before we start our show we never
did it but i was i was
thinking we should all get in a huddle
and listen to lose yourself because i'm
like this is the moment
for any like
life-defining moment you listen to lose
yourself and you know that's going to
take you over the edge we listened to it
before my brother's wedding oh he did
yeah and when i walked out i just
started
i just wrestled one of the bridesmaids
yeah yeah yeah
she got you in a nice pretty nice arm
bar she did choke me out
yeah cause i slipped the arm bar and
then she got behind my neck yeah and i
wasn't gonna tap but my brother was like
dude you got to officiate yeah and i was
like all right fair fair fair yeah yeah
but i mean she's like six two two ten
yeah i mean you came up to me later and
you were like you know i had her right
i was like yeah yeah sure sure that's
how i started the wedding too he's like
i had her didn't i
oh man
all right dearly beloved [ __ ] um
all right so chad with a huge pick
oh also greg ebel mentioned about that
song
best song for highlight tapes on youtube
correct oh you have a high school
wrestling video
i think her actually we watched some of
her state wrestling the advisory that
took you down yeah i think she did use
lose yourself for her melinda yep
just her throwing around dudes um okay
let's see guys this is tough chad you
really changed things with that pic but
i should have been expecting it
i'm so fired up um
let's see baby
let's cruise
okay i'm gonna go with an all-time
classic right here
this is a pump up song that after you've
just won the championship you're in the
locker room everyone's dick is out and
you're [ __ ] just feeling so good and
you're listening to house of pain jump
around dude yeah jump up and get down
and it just has that iconic
it's and it gives you instructions for
getting pumped up so i'm like if if
you're an alien
on earth and you're like wait how am i
going to get pumped up oh don't worry i
got you yeah how's the pain
do they need to shoot a movie scene
where everyone has their dicks out you
know maybe the coal miners from uh
chernobyl and they're listening to jump
around if yeah if they had jump around
going on after you after you accomplish
something you put this song on you're
gonna feel good yeah
[Music]
it's like one it's one of those ones
we're like dude that does fire
dude i'm so pumped up now dude
oh yeah you can picture an old lady like
kind of lightly getting her arms in the
air yeah
dogs humping each other to it you know
what it's it's
it's good spirited yeah it's like pure
fun there's not a lot of like uh there's
nothing ugly about that song no that's
why old people can party to it right
because it's just
it's just like let's go it's so sick
great pick chris you got two
my god
i'll take your time oh my gosh this is
tough going back-to-back's tough dude
i'm gonna go
with
i like to party to both these songs
now we're talking
one the first one it's not like a zombie
by the cranberries oh interesting
[ __ ] love this song it's a great song
yeah also the deepest song that's been
mentioned so far because that's about uh
that's about like the ira and stuff like
that right
uh about what
the troubles
which
i know what the troubles are but maybe
you could explain that to me real quick
so i can relate to the audience here's a
mic aaron yeah
oh internal uh irish strife with the
catholics for the cokes first the pepsis
catholics first of protestants yeah so
it gets me fired up because it's very
emotional but it's still a rock song you
know
and uh it is a weird song to party too
since it is very serious but i don't
know it never stopped
us and my boys in college that was like
one of the songs that we would play
pretty much every time we drank
yes i love it and then the next one i'm
going to go what should we play this one
first yeah let's play it let's fill it
out
i also think chris it's a weird pick and
i think you've sent the whole draft on a
different trajectory i think so too it's
going to get more personal after this
and how can you that's the thing lose
yourself would have been like my
everyone knows this but then when that
was gone i was like all right i'm just
gonna go
very personal to what gets me extremely
emotional which is usually what pumped
up is for
dude how many times have you been
driving to that and then you pulled up
to dell talking to be like i'd like
delferno sauce with a black bean burrito
a large fanta
and then boom immediately
let me actually make that del scorcho
dude that's a great pick dude here is
um
it's so tough because there's so many
choices i know yeah that's why i think
i'm just gonna get super personal and
i'm gonna go and that song builds
dude and then you can just yell zombie
but zombae
if you don't know any of the words you
just say
she said the sisters just say bombs a
lot
yeah it works and they're bombs and
their bombs yeah you can tell if someone
just doesn't know the song if they don't
say bombs twice if they [ __ ] that'll be
on you i've heard you don't really know
listen to it
i don't know once a month
um i'm gonna go
i'm gonna go with another
female vocalist
nice dude
you do love chicks the most of all of us
for sure i like him second most chris is
a huge chicks guy
[Laughter]
saw the chicks on tuesday
[Music]
i'm gonna go with uh
chandelier by sia oh dude yeah yeah bro
christopher this is such an interesting
list yeah i love sia it was really tough
with elastic hearts it's kind of 1a 1b
um
but that song's about [ __ ] raging
like too
hard it's also super fun to rage
hard to these are great picks man you're
very emotionally specific yeah well
that's what i really
pumped up for me is always just like
i do like like the raw raw rock and
stuff but for the most i i still respond
to that but the ones that really get to
me are like
hyper emotional
usually with a chick singing and
freaking belting i got one later that's
in that category that's what we used to
drive around to when we were driving on
antonio
we just have like a song like that and
the the pump up was that we were so
unguarded in our emotions yeah
like you just i like songs where you
feel a ton and it's less um
yeah very latin chandelier it's like you
know she's talking she's just talking
about like raging too hard and how it's
like [ __ ] up her life
again
kind of weird to party too but it
totally works also with your
personalization of the list i think she
was gonna sell that song to someone else
and then some her managers or producers
are like no you just have to do this so
like your list very you this song also
varies
and these are the songs that i like to
work out too i love that
um just because i get really excited
excited to hear you guys ready to hear
it yeah
[Music]
[Music]
i mean that is a raging soul that is a
soul
raging against the interminable pain of
life she is screaming back at the abyss
in that one life you do your worst for i
will do mine that's what she's saying
exactly dude and you know what's the
ultimate party move to [ __ ] jump on
the chandelier and swing from it baby
someone does that let's go
and it's a it's an act of destruction
yeah
what does cat do in 10 things i hate
about you she's dancing on a table what
takes her out of chandelier what do we
do when meaningless is slapping us in
the face we destroy corrupt we burn it
down
[ __ ] great i bet you're the joker
listen to that song he probably did
before he robbed the bank but he was
just like
yeah when he got emotional about him
they never show you what the joker was
doing he was by himself at home
exactly yeah when he's like he's playing
wordle
he's texting his henchman his first word
is always just joker yeah yeah
sick
[Laughter]
i watch this video of this beaver that
would eat this farmer's crops in front
of his camera every day it's so [ __ ]
funny
just the joker the joker watching that
he's like this beaver's hilarious
that's what i would do if i was a beaver
he's like really into deer you know he
reads a lot of books on him
he shows up late to work one time
doesn't have his makeup on he's like i
forgot to set my alarm
i'm just going right there like dude
come on man like you were supposed to
freak everybody out he's like it's fine
it's fine oh make it up on the back end
yeah
i'll shoot an extra person um strider
you're up all right here we go
chris left some chalk on the board with
his list
but i'm not going for the chalk baby
i love where we're going inspired by
chris right now yeah we're all going
deeper now
and this band has a lot of just this is
my go-to workout i put this band
just greatest hits or any old album
on there to work out too but this is my
off-roading song whoa this is also
category [ __ ] the man this is what i
off-road to
and this is rage against the machine
killing in the name
dude
it just gets me so and dude literally it
says [ __ ] you i won't do what you tell
me yeah i mean bro is there anything
better like dude i was literally showing
it to my dank fiance today and she's
like i was like you know it's not her
type of music but she was like hell yeah
dude she did a quick lane change i was
like you usually don't do that but that
was nice it's righteous dude it's
righteous rebellion yes it's like [ __ ]
you i won't do what you tell me it's
amazing and the way it builds because
you're kind of quiet and you're just
like with your boys you're like [ __ ] you
and then you feel yourself starting to
get more and more pumped up and then
that chorus comes in about that point
very easy song to mosh too oh dude
you're motion
and he does say [ __ ] you i won't do what
you tell me like 40 times yeah it's very
easy like if it's your first time
hearing it like oh you catch on pretty
quick
if you're a teenager and you don't know
how to verbally communicate with your
stepdad slam the door to your room then
skip to about three minutes in this song
and you've aced it message loud and
clear received dude i'll tell you i in
high school i took 10 adderall one time
and
you're pumped up yeah
i've been there
just banned in general what would i
listen to rage against the machine thank
you brother remember malcolm or hallm on
it or like proctor
you know i was just cranking rage
against renegades a funk was on
he comes and i was writing a paper
and he's like
he comes he's like what the [ __ ] are you
doing
what
dude writing an essay to that kind of
great dude the essay is going to be
powerful
it was on like huck finn or something
you're like will the government try to
take huck thing down and [ __ ] the
government dude
craft is a metaphor yeah and
corporations due to the [ __ ] you know
the riverboats that's the other thing
about rage against machines they they're
like they put a lot of big stuff into
their songs like they'll reference like
the civil rights movement and stuff yeah
so it always gets a little elevated too
where you're like yeah i'm just dumb and
angry and then you're like but i'm
fighting for real causes
yeah it puts you in line with something
powerful yeah there's like the album
covers like a buddhist monk what's it
called self flash or not self like oh
self immolation self
yeah very gnarly the duty did it in
front of the uh
what is it square yeah i think yeah
there's a great article about how they
snuck that film out of a china really
yeah that's a great move it was it could
be like an argo yeah it was cool like
they had to be real secret agent about
it to get the photos back to western
like media that's a great movie dude
also funny about the step dad thing i
almost feel like with the inverse and
power now between kids and parents right
that like i can more easily picture
myself as the step dad putting that song
on and closing my door unlocking
and then and then the nine-year-old kid
has to hear and i'm like [ __ ] you
dude
so true if the kid does put it on i mean
you probably grew up the stepdad
probably grew up with this song so then
he can kick down the door and be like
singing along to it and then you know
he's immediately gonna be like [ __ ]
i'm not listening to this yeah you're
not gonna feel out persecuted to me dude
if i have to take care of you like
you're gonna try and use rage against me
dog i was in high school when this came
out yeah you can't do that yeah yeah i
was born in the darkness all right
should we listen to it yeah baby
[Music]
cutting around is i'm just by yourself
at holy gyms just [ __ ] in your mom's
honda yeah
hacker mdx just the underrated thing
about off-roading tuesday you're owning

[Music]
i listened to this song i was working at
a diner yeah and i had an abusive
husband yes and finally i just met like
a kindly old uh line cook at the
restaurant who like had lost his wife 30
years ago but loved her true and it just
a beautiful like hard-earned wisdom on
the world and he told me it was time for
me to get free and move to the big city
and after i went home and i
kicked that piece of [ __ ]
hubby in the balls i grabbed my bag and
i drove to this song on my way to
california um no i love that dude
that is exactly right
that's when it pumps me that's a [ __ ]
beautiful word picture that you just
painted thanks man
yeah i'd say um
for me
yeah i think it's
i think it's it reminds me of like your
first crush
and you cruise in 10 years later
and you just do a burnout in front of
their place and then you just like do
donuts then you get out of the car and
you flip your
caller up one billion percent yeah
and you make out with them
all right
dude arenas i got two picks right now
here we go baby all right um
i'm being pulled in a lot of different
directions here
i think i'm gonna save my weird one for
fourth and i'm gonna go chalk right here
yeah i think it's smart i'm going with
two workout songs
i'm going with another eminem banger
yep i know that i don't think is as good
of a song as lose yourself but i think
for the specific purpose of working out
it's the best song of all time
especially if it's in a team setting i'm
going till i collapse correct it's a
great one great song eminem and nate
dawg yeah i mean nate dawg
greatest voice in history the best
singer of all time if it's a hook from
the 2000s yeah
he's singing all the hooks yeah and uh
yeah there's just the aggression of it
and and the testosterone of it and it
never fails to make me move when i'm
when i'm lifting did the intro down down
down down down
down and this like for me it's like full
teen angst
you know yeah this is where i just came
out i was like
i was like mom don't [ __ ] tell me to
do homework yup yup you know and then
dude i'll just pitch you in that weight
room just picture in santa margaret
weight room boys are just putting extra
plates on your squat rack right you know
you're getting an extra plate up on the
squat rack when this song comes on dude
all the boys are around and there's that
like whatever that [ __ ] noise is
so sick
all right you guys ready listen yeah
ready to get pumped up
also the little story preamble from
eminem yeah you gotta reach deep down
inside of you and not be acquitted and
not give up and then the lyrics coming
you're like
he's right he's so angry in this one
he's he's it's
he's pissed
[Music]
off as long as you feel him to the day
that i dropped that face that that song
will put like a wide earp into your face
that yeah you just be ready to face down
the uh
the cowboys
[Music]
all right dude i think i'm gonna stay
with my
um
workout theme and for my next song
i'm going trapped head strong
this might be i think july collapse is
your best workout song if you're working
out with other guys if you're by
yourself i think headstrong by trapped
is the best
is the best one
it's so dumb
but
it taps into such
good
adolescent fury where the chorus just
goes head strong i'll take you on
headstrong i'll take on anyone and you
can just picture yourself surrounded by
a thousand people and just screaming
that at them a little bit like killing
in the name of yeah same way you say
[ __ ] you i won't do what you tell me
this chorus is something you feel like
shouting at a mob yes that's trying to
face you down let's go
um and this is actually probably the
song that i have the most workout time
put into
yeah because in high school it was on
every workout placement it was kind of
like it was what like
seventh grade eighth grade through ohio
high school yeah
we heard it for the first time on
vacation in cape cod in the car and i
remember in that moment knowing my life
had changed forever
something's different
it's like when dylan went a lecture
i mean dude yeah bro
dude
also also what
one more thing that makes this song so
good
i don't think this band ever had another
relevant song
this is what they had to say to the
world this is what mattered to the rest
of the world
[Music]
too many bands when we were in high
school made that their whole song
screamo the hardcore stuff i could never
get into that was like
and all those guys would yeah blow out
their voice boxes they'd be like did you
hear about jesse from stick to your guns
you can't sing for five years exactly
brown
maybe you're not supposed to sing like
that yeah like you're not supposed to
growl for an hour and that's the thing i
like growls but it's like
it's a scalpel you know use it with
precision use it once in a while just to
get me in that attitude but the whole
song i need some melody i need some like
you know real vocals no disrespects
aren't all the people out there who like
scream out yeah
you guys look i like shitty music but
you really like shitty music exactly
exactly yeah [ __ ] it's pretty bad all
right wait wait so before we start
should we we should do five picks right
probably probably because i'm starting
to think of these because i'm getting
inspired but we should probably we gave
you proper time to set up for sure for
sure for sure
i just it's just probably just
i'm actually good because i think i had
yeah we should probably all do ten let's
just do it let's just do ten
muscle
music yeah dude let's do a seven hour
hour
you guys are free for the next nine
hours right
yeah i'm good i can work out during the
pod
yeah
we're just trying to do it start lifting
kettlebells
um chad you're up dog
um
all right
it's it's tough to pick um
it's so hard i think i gotta go with the
one that really made me
introduce me to like horny workout
classes
and i still listen to the category
listen to to this day
probably the hottest music video of all
time i think i know yeah and
every time i hear it i just picture
literally every time i hear this song i
picture me and
all my boys and and my you know
gf at the same time you know in sort of
like a squat position
doing a collective hump i know where
you're going you know because the beat
is just
you know you're just all humping at the
same time it's sexual makes you want to
work out it's something that you
envision like
you know popping out of a stage too you
know you're just like
[Music]
um
and so i got to go call out me by eric
pritz dude great pic man and i wouldn't
have thought of it i mean
100 the greatest music video of all time
the guy they it is like perfect perfect
because he's kind of good looking but
he's also an every man so you can kind
of picture yourself as him yeah and then
the women that they casted amazing in
the video and then the instructor dude
they used to play it at bars on like
taco tuesdays and i remember when it
would come on no matter what i was doing
yeah
all my focus would just move towards the
tv yeah and i'd just be
it was totally
like locked in for the remainder of the
song it was like in possession of me it
was really strong it's so good and i
mean there's the one move where they're
oh maybe that's the uh john travolta
movie but where they're just like
they're all humping looking at each
other and i'll literally be in workout
classes just envisioning that where
you're just that one guy you're just
you're like short shorts on just yes
um yeah it's kind of the dream to be the
cool guy at the hot female workout class
it's the dream and and you know what
the girls you know
workout outfit
is the best thing i've ever seen i i
have to actually i swear to god when you
started talking about it i started
getting wood yeah oh yeah we all got
what we all we all knew what you were
talking about we're all like this is
really you see my life getting across
get rid of my work
you got me kind of warm
can you keep talking about
but uh i know dude she's that really tan
ass and just like full thong leotard and
it's not too sexual it's all kind of
like
it's
but it's at like a pg-13 level there's
nothing too oh my god okay yeah hey for
this one should we watch the music video
too
yeah
i think the four butts we're in too wait
for the hump
oh
you know what
this is the best thing it's better than
anything
[Laughter]
who are you i'd hate him the music video
but call on me and i'm like that's what
we're capable of
around
you guys what do you want to do for your
music video and he's like i got it
dude that song doesn't pump me up to
work out it pumps me up to not care
about working out and just be like life
is awesome dude yeah yeah
jack off oh yeah dude that's the best
pump up to jackoff song
that's a category that's a category
dude did you invent a whole new category
what about nine inch nails animal
that's not too kind of just is it true
is it too ugly
yeah it's too late yeah i want to [ __ ]
you like those are like the flip sides
of the same coin almost yeah
i don't think he's going for fun in that
one no no no no that one's like this is
all fun
animals like
whoa
but for your chicks are into serial
killers that's number one yeah yeah or
like and all chicks are into serial
killers and you called out why strider i
think it's because they empathize with
the threat of being killed by a guy no
you said it's because they want their
money true they're coming after your
money dude
that's the thing dude they get famous
write a book they just want your money
just trying to get it two points all
right straight through up dude all right
dude this is tough dude i mean how do
you follow something so like that's just
the perfect it's different and the video
that goes along with it wasn't it that
was very important with the video yeah
whoa
there's still a lot of chalk on here
just dude but dude i'm playing it play
sorry playing the eric prince call on me
son for your football team before a game
i would love to see what that did
yeah it's something that you'd have a
fun time yeah everyone's gonna walk like
this
yeah exactly everyone's got the boner
and like the offensive lines doing like
a synchronized dance before they get
into position then the quarterback's
like lightly humping the center
this is the this is what i pictured
yes good dude
it's good dude hey take your time take
your time dude your pants game has been
on fire by the way just so you know yeah
you wore cool pants yesterday so you're
trying to switch it up yeah yeah
thanks
all right uh
man damn dude
all right
dog you might be [ __ ] bro this song is
a banger
and i could get this puppy later and
less i don't think anyone's thinking it
but
you gotta go with what you like
and when i was doing my pump up research
this is actually the song that i was
listening to the most
and it sort of is taking my list in this
like screw the government sort of uh
thing but that's but you hate rules or
you like messing with your rules fantasy
fantasy the giraffes yeah i do the same
but yeah but yeah i'm not throwing this
in a piece of [ __ ] no but you're
rebellious towards the yeah you know
you're right
and this is true to who i am and this
song rips and i've listened to it
and i'll tell you right now
confession before i tell to tell you
what the song is
i was blasting this song on hollywood
boulevard one time going to an improv
show
windows fully down on hollywood making a
right dude kind of by cohenga and there
was a dude walking by
and he heard and he like said something
to me and i was like what and i turned
down and he goes
you're cool
[Laughter]
that guy was black no wonder
i'm for real dude and as i've been a
white dude from work and it's brave to
say that dude but
that was the there's no one cooler that
that's like
all my whole entire middle school
childhood through high school just
trying to be cool in that manner and you
know what cuz because you were being
authentic and that can translate across
any culture race or creed and sure i had
my windows down but
i i needed the bass to get out and and
this is uh public enemy harder than you
think oh dude i don't think i know this
one you know it you've heard it
he's popping up his buddy too in this
song
[Music]
do when it hits
they were such an interesting team it
worked so well chris can i house this
do you want it you want to share it
you take it you take
[Music]
you know what this song's so good for if
you gotta if you've got a long day ahead
of you shopping with your girlfriend and
you're going to the mall you don't know
if you got the necessary endurance to
make it through like you might only be
able to hit two stores that day and you
know she's on like a seven store mission
you listen to that song you walk into
that store ready for anything 100
100 ready for [ __ ] war dude [ __ ]
so sick dude
so i'm firing up on that public enemy
baby
chris
uh i'm gonna go with
a corny classic rock song from my
childhood
that i introd
give a little taste of it papa roach
last resort
nice too bro
yeah dude you know what you need it
because this is like the first
self-hating
pump up song
it's the first self-hating pump up song
you need that it's just like it's
when suicide was badass
a lot of emotional ones so i mean we can
play it because i'm gonna switch it up
on my next one
um but yeah i mean it's so
corny
and um
again you kind of get lost and that it's
supposed to be heavy because it's just
like
really fun and stupid
yeah yes it's
amazing it's very angsty it's like
jeremy talk [ __ ] on me at school yeah
jessica's going out with hunter yeah my
parents didn't let me go out last
weekend
last resort yeah yeah like when people
were like what do you what do you know
you
you have a you have a big house and
you're like dude i feel anxious
sometimes yeah that bomb on them yeah i
have pain too
yeah they're like you don't have real
problems here yeah i got real hormones
though [ __ ] all right
i'm a [ __ ] bastion of feelings over
here [ __ ]
no [ __ ] appreciate that and recognize
and then we can stand eye to eye and
talk about who we really are dude
a lot of the songs i picked i like to
sing in the car yeah i remember this one
like even live in high school i lost my
voice by like the second chorus oh hello
i was just singing it so hard it's very
good for violent hand gestures too
you know it's like you know what's weird
about this song too it also inspires me
to jack off well yeah yeah cause the
suffocation part you like to do that a
little bit right you've dabbled with
that you like to go out yeah you like
the lights to be dimming yeah right as
well the chandelier explodes the two you
know going
you're but you really haven't dialed in
you try to give me a lesson one time but
yeah yeah i need my breath and the race
is always kind of finished before the
song's over true that's the thing i was
telling you i'm pretty sure i can do it
before desrae you gotta be comes on
let's do that
i was telling i was like straighter you
got you have to want to pass out yeah
that's true that's true you gotta want
it it has to come from inside and i'm
afraid of it if you're afraid to go
under
you'll never
blast through
so [ __ ] dude that was beautiful what
you just said right there thanks dude
i'm really pumped up you've been seeing
a lot of beautiful [ __ ] this song's got
me fired up dude i'm drunk too let's go
i'm a little bit buzzed
[Music]
i've had a lot of really emotional ones
so i need something that's just
light and fun and i'm going and i this
is another one
most especially with uh
my boys in college this one would get us
[ __ ] ant you just have such a fun
time
and that's don't stop me now by queen
don't stop me
cause i'm having such a good time i'm
having a ball
don't
stop just so fun yes you you just end up
bouncing around the room when it comes
on
uh because it's just got that vibe to it
uh you know but he also talks about
being uh
you know exploding and being you know
yes just [ __ ]
going really [ __ ] fast and just
having a ball
and um
yeah i love this one
it's don't stop me now
i don't think i know this one oh you
don't know when you're here
by queen yeah when you're all [ __ ] up
with your boys and you hear this you're
having a good time and you're just
prancing all right
so for you to get pumped up for you to
get pumped up it's really about
unleashing your inner
theatrical emotional dancer
yeah for
100 i also
want to be able to sing to it
uh but you want to be in a higher
register when you sing
yeah mostly i mean because i guess for a
lot of like the
like you mentioned earlier like the i
feel like when i was younger a lot of
them were like
saliva and like those like in that vein
of getting pumped up
but by the time i was getting out of
high school those ones didn't do as much
for me maybe it's because we listen to
so much emo stuff well you get a little
older too you realize it's kind of
ridiculous to be that angry at things
yeah and i guess almost emo sex segwayed
me into gaity
yeah no like legit no
and like and like better music that had
that could be emotional and you could
rock out too but just wasn't um and it
felt more subversive to you to be merry
than to be
like malicious or i just liked being
married more i like that it's more fun i
mean like the thing is a lot of these
are sad songs but you just kind of we
would just
you can still party because you can kind
of party to anything and it's just ones
that caught on with the boys you know
[Music]
yeah it just brings me back to dorm
parties you know just partying in a room
standing on couches it's very fun but
that's also something you could party
with when you have kids or you got a
wedding like you can dance with i can
picture like my knees stance into that
too yeah
you know like i said it's really amazing
it gives you a lot of connective fun
yeah yeah so francine you like to prance
you're almost like there's animals that
prance
oh yeah 100
deers
back to deer elk yep elk horses that are
trained mooses i think dogs even do dogs
oh yeah some do yeah yeah
yep no cruise around
strider
all right
this is getting yeah
i'll get some more yeah
this is gonna be tough i mean look
i have a way right now where i could
really genre bend and ruin the list
but i'm not gonna do that because we're
having such a good just do it don't stop
me we're having such a good time that i
can't do that i can't be an animal all
these lists have been great
uh
i gotta go i'm thinking of two ways i
could go with what gets me and my boys
fired up when we were in high school or
i could go with just such good solid
chalk
that's so sick
which w are you chasing
i'm going personal yeah to thine own
self be true if anything else and i'm
going to go take him back sunday cut
with cute without that oh what a
beautiful nice yeah
so much [ __ ] fun dude it's angsty
it's teeny and dude we all sang it at
our boy daniel's wedding literally
we looked at all of our loved ones and
we said
get off the floor the boys are getting
on there and we all just [ __ ] danced
around
hung out dude hugged each other
it was on we were ripping each other's
ties but it was cool
and it was just so much fun yeah angst
is such a powerful driver for
expression yes right
like dude totally your lipstick's
calling don't bother enjoy you know
exactly what goes
and this is a very
it's a very specific kind of partying
where you're literally like grabbing
your friend's shoulders you're all in
like kind of a uh
like a rugby scrum and you're just like
rubbing heads yelling at each other yes
which is kind of the best form of
partying in a lot of ways it's amazing
and you can play it in your car have a
good time
every time i've been ever been denied by
a girl a lot of times in high school
this song would come on there's also one
more song
that i really thought of for doing for
this but this one had more joy to it and
more fun for it for me and i think you
know the other one
and two singers singing during it that's
fun because
then you can duet with your homie yeah
i loved it it was so fun remember our
boy johnson would come over he would
play it like because we had the little
music area they would all jam we'd hop
on the vocals so much fun dude all right
should i play it
yes we're about to go bananas

just
you know thinking about jacking off
still
[Music]
and um
i haven't done it in a couple days i've
been trying to preserve my seed
and it feels good to feel focused
and i'm just thinking about my next pump
up song which i think is going to really
you know show the world that
it's okay to be amped
and um
yeah yeah i've been calling rick a lot
and he's like don't you dare come don't
come
and i was like
i was like rick why can't i come he's
like because you need to preserve your
chi and i'm like [ __ ] that's why i
called you i totally forgot
totally forgot
just holding that jizz in my balls
i like it someone on the reddit was like
they're very nuanced humor and guys like
nuance they talk about dongs and t-bags
yeah but it's a nuanced tank okay it's a
nuanced take on dongs and tea bags
all right chad you're up dude all right
guys this is a rock song that you know
it's a band that i still wish was
cranking out he because
i love a lot of their songs they have a
lot of songs that i love and this is a
band that you can listen to if you want
to get in touch with god
let's go you know
one of the coolest
lead singers of all time now we're
talking and this song every time i hear
it i have to sing along and i have to
say what up to the almighty even though
i'm not even religious i just go what up
father
i'm here
the best the best music makes you
believe in god yes
religious picking higher by creed
you know just
head bang with the boys while getting in
touch with the lord if you want a
headbang with god yeah this is the sign
if you want to feel like jesus yeah
knocking domes with himself
to the universe can you take me higher
and the video of him like being
dissatisfied backstage and then coming
out in front of the crowd and just
belting oh oh it's such a great song
dude it's a great karaoke song yeah i
think i did this at karaoke night
remember we all raged after the show
yeah that's funny
it's one of those songs too where like
people can be like ironically like are
you listening to creed you listen to
creep but i'm like it's undeniable when
hire comes on you're gonna sing along
and you're gonna [ __ ] get fired up
yeah people look down on getting pumped
up sometimes you know you're just gonna
eliminate like 90 percent of life yeah
pumped up that's my favorite feeling is
being pumped up this could be a beef but
the beef of like oh that's basic or
stuff like you you're basically like
yeah i'm basic because it's dank i like

collared shirt like deflects
anything that could make you feel yeah
what are you into making
loose leaf tea yeah eating green cookies
yeah when you're into like specific
things yeah
yeah it's like take your key lime pie
and shove it up your ass exactly and
you're into things where there's no
competition i'm into stuff where
everyone's going for it hey [ __ ] men
dude yeah
all right i think i [ __ ] pick should
we play it yes yeah
dude everyone's fired of course
dude even if we can't play the songs
it's just all of our smiles after
listening yeah yeah guys we just
listened to hired by creating so sick
dude the skulls and the skulls
come in
the chips
yes
and everybody gets one chick but then
they show paul walking out and he's got
two
he's got ten shakes dude he just looks
like he just throws up like a later dude
what a playful play
did you play this one chicks show up to
anything
[Laughter]
like three chicks
you believe in god you're like god is
good dude
it's true
it's true
brother
[Music]
[Laughter]
ends with them getting
new whips new cars
all great pump up songs have to
like match nicely with montage and stuff
yeah a lot of them were like oh i did
like google like what are like the best
montage songs dude that's great it's so
funny like in high school and stuff and
that guy would be like hooking up with a
girl and be walking out of the party and
just give you the
oh dude amazing bro
i remember one time dude our buddy was
gonna like get into a bunch of fights
one night
and i was gonna talk to him and i'm like
yo hey what happened to
so-and-so because he was just like
walking from fight to fight yeah and
then his younger brother came up to me
and he had a cigarette in his mouth even
though he's like 15 he goes he's all
good man he just had to cool off on a
chick
who's
absorbing all that do you want to know
i think i want a song that's good i'm
gonna i might go with two bone songs
all right you like working out and
boning dude this is very you and i i
wanna i want a club anthem i want a song
that gets me fired up at the club and
for me this is the number one song for
that and i think maybe the greatest song
in history it's [ __ ] problems by
aesop rocky yeah
kendrick and it has the line in it that
i think is the best for bald ego
aggression is when kendrick lamar says
girl i know you want this dude yeah and
the way he says dick is maybe the best
lion delivery in history
it's so true
i'm going with it
i'm sorry no go baby
it's unbelievable i know did you never
yeah bro
i like the core conflict in this song
because it's your problem is that you
[ __ ] too much it's a great issue to have
and i think that's the best problem you
can have yeah and these guys are we've
all been there these guys are dealing
with it but they're clearly pumped up
about it yeah
[Music]
and then you got
i think three great rappers on it all
going at it and it might be it's nice to
see i'll get a first time yeah i like to
[ __ ] i got a [ __ ] problem yeah like a
[ __ ] i got a [ __ ] problem because
like you could tell he's like pretty
pumped up on him yeah he's like he
doesn't do you really think that or you
just say do you know
it's clearly something someone else has
told him there's a problem and he's like
he's like oh yeah i hate hearing that
yeah
oh yeah i forgot i get too much [ __ ]
yeah my bad
is just glaring at someone and the
structure is great how do they they all
end their verse in the same way don't
they what are they what does all the
beast yeah beast beast dude it's so
[ __ ] good bro it's a great it's a
great banger and then dude
nah i was just so sick dude baby you're
great
[Music]
i need an emotional cathartic song
i'm going pink just like a pill oh
what a great song
i love this [ __ ] tune dude it's so
good
it's a vulnerability pump up
it's like uh it's this it's like the
[ __ ] you kind of mentality but i just
make pop music which is
perfect i love it i think it's great you
know she you look at her and you go you
offer it yeah so she her boyfriend her
husband's carry heart yeah
first guy to do a backflip on a
motorcycle not land it but first got to
do it i mean that's true that's
groundbreaking he was the first one to
take that shot this is why it's called
the heartbreaker [ __ ] yeah is it really
cool actually it's called the
heartbreaker it's a different move isn't
it the heartbreaker is the one where i
think he goes off the back of it
holds the thing for a second and then
comes back again
it might have been the one where he did
like a hand oh no that was the
heartbreaker the one where
i think it's a handstand off the back i
think i think he arches his back he's
like yeah i thought it was the one where
he like grabs the back and like sticks
his hips up oh that one where you fold
backwards like you're doing
like you're doing like that i thought
that was like you're [ __ ] doing a
hamstring
maybe one was called a heart attack or
something the heart attack was the other
one oh bro
this one's so fun
time to get hammered
[Music]
just a total
cathartic
monster of a possibility
we need to be at a house party right now
shut up songs grab it guys
this is it's almost frustrating me my
gift were rocking to that song yesterday
and i was just people were walking by
the street we were just pointing at them
like we were just yearning
for humans to see us oh it was it was
really strong
um all right chad
your last pick dude man this is tough
[ __ ]
um
you know uh
okay
i mean there's one there's like a
sort of the edm classic i could go with
no i already have calling me i think i
know i already have call me now i'm not
gonna do that
that's a big one yeah
[Music]
yeah i gotta go with this one okay this
is
there's a drinking game to this one one
of my favorite drinking games
um you got to go with some you know 70s
80s rock classics
and this one is just uh
it's thunderstruck by ac dc great you
can't go wrong i can't go wrong you know
we didn't have much classic rock we
needed more of it yeah queen queen was
on there but yeah it was tough between
that and i was thinking no easy way out
by robert tepper from rocky iv that was
my pick no i'm kidding
i was thinking of that one too but i
think i think thunderstruck because the
drinking game is phenomenal have you
guys played the drama no so every time
that he says thunder you get in a circle
every time they say thunder one guy
starts chugging thunder switches over
the next guy thunder and then you just
chug for as long until the next thunder
comes in then it goes to the next guy
but there's one where
you could get [ __ ] where it says
thunder and it's like a minute hit the
check for like a minute
best game ever [ __ ] thunderstruck [ __ ]
we should play a game with vo
what did you play that game with vo
vodka vodka
oh
no dude i played it with ski
oh [ __ ] did you think beau was a guy
yeah oh yeah i was like is that some
dude
is that the guy i had to cool off on a
chick
can you imagine that either
you could fight a bunch of people
or go finger someone and that's the only
way that your night could end because
that's how this
is amazing they could [ __ ] yeah
there's two outcomes there's fight or
flight but when you're of a certain age
and have a certain testosterone level
it's it's fight or [ __ ] right
those are the only two primal outlets
for those energies um
yeah i think
i'm gonna go pick a fight
[Music]
holy guacamole dude
i've been sticking to stuff like that i
listen to that pumps me up so hard
and at this point i might
as the bender delve into a different
genre definitely not genre bending
because this song is a pump up song it
gets the crowd going going classical
dude yeah beethoven's ninth uh some of
those those some of those scores well
somebody scores i thought about moving
the scores
yeah honorable mentions is gonna be fun
a lot of them um
this is just on my mind and i was
inspired by this in the moment of what
we were talking about i don't know if
we'll do the pre-fodder for the podcast
but
i went to um stagecoach
and i saw this artist perform and no one
puts on a show
like garth dude
and he does rodeo so i'm going garth
brooks rodeo dude wow interesting it
gets you moving i guess the ladies going
it's a lot of jean shorts it's a
competition for sexiness
there's a lot of sexiness not in the
video but you're doing an electric slide
and just it gets me going
i don't think garth brooks is on
oh yeah you can't like get garth brooks
songs that's a problem oh dude if
there's any song that's going to give
rights issues
should i do a new song because of that
no all right we can listen to it real
quick and let's just not talk during
this one since we don't know okay and
we'll just see if there's probably
you know i should have just stuck to my
guns dude what was your other option
gonna be
no one's gonna pick it i was gonna do um
alt j if it's pleasure i don't know that
one it's really fun
so we gotta we should
we should party
dude don't you want a party right now
yeah this is this whole thing that's
right
i'm actually getting frustrated because
i'm like [ __ ] i'm gonna have all this
energy also going to be a couple beers
there same thing
and then chill for a second then i might
go home and pack
i'm gonna game
this is it
[Music]
[Music]
so the next time we party i'll be able
to get in on the action with you it's
american it's like a teddy roosevelt
poem that thing is like
it's old american mythos and like i want
to sleep with that guy he's a beast i
want to sleep with guard he can't be
with her because he's too into the rodeo
exactly that's his true love is the
rodeo dude because he's a wild man that
makes me up on a cowboy hat 100 yeah
dude if you wear a cowboy hat put my
girlfriend a flannel just
whip her down give her a smooch
that's exactly the essence i was going
for is it's the experience of that's not
one to actually if i'm driving listening
in my car i am fired up on that but it's
like when that comes on at a country
western bar
or you're at a stage coach or something
like that you're immediately you're up
you're electric sliding
there's jean shorts you're in your boots
you're in your hat
you are [ __ ] popping your texas belt
buckling when you hear that song and to
the visual of riding
like
the great cartoonist robert crumbs yes
he wasn't into conventional sex and his
girlfriend
in the wonderful documentary about him
said for him he would just ride her
around the living room like she was a uh
a bucking bronco that's beautiful oh
interesting and hopefully he rode for
more than eight seconds for her sake
yeah come on if you're going to make her
get down there give it a full show yeah
start i love every image of you like
in boots and the cowboy hat she's doing
the electric slide with a boner dude
thank you here's the thing i have a very
deep insecurity about being all hat and
no horse it's why i want to start riding
horses more i go on solo
like the group rides there's a lot of
families than just me
uh here at griffith park
because you can do a horseback ride
there
and it's just i want more horse
experience in the saddle i still don't
know what i'm doing the animal's in
control
uh maybe that's my problem i look at it
like an animal when it's a being
so
thank you for that imagery but i want i
want the authenticity yeah i think the
horse is okay with being both to you
you're good on a horse yeah
you can you can post very well
dece but i can hold on real well
i spooked a horse one time i'm there for
a good time not a long time and the
horse can feel that from me
you're good
compared to me man you're [ __ ]
amazing thank you you know what is great
advice for every stoker listening
this is great advice
if you're looking to if you have your
eye on a lady you're of dating age
invite a girl to go horseback riding if
you can and you have the means it's a
little bit of dough but what's gonna oh
you want to go see a movie everyone's
going to see a movie maybe she's not
interested in that movie
every girl is going to want to go
horseback riding i don't know one girl
that won't can i add an extra part to
that date yeah you're riding horses
together you're unsupervised because you
have the expertise requirement to thank
you guy drone
trail ride and then uh come upon an
animal that's in distress and give it
medical attention holy [ __ ] top-notch
version of that
uh a cow's giving birth and you help
pull the little guy out you have to put
your hand in his ass
honey stay there hold on
okay baby it's okay it's okay
she's like i think you're in the wrong
hole
you're like don't worry about me i know
what i'm doing down here i've done this
a thousand times
baby okay baby come on i'm this
this is second nature to me
you just haven't discovered [ __ ]
this kyle swallowed my shark watch last
week i needed to get it
i think i got it i think i got it
chris you ready to take us home yeah
like i said this one is uh
uh i'm going
with the song by lil john
uh the cindy sampson remix to out of
your mind
great song good yeah though
let me see i think i have it queued up
because spotify doesn't have the right
version
this one's got way more lasers
[Music]
[Music]
dude i immediately got so amped up dude
this is also a song when you're too
[ __ ] up at the club and you're like i
need to go home
this is always the song that's on you're
like oh
did you make good decisions to this song
you're like i'm done
yeah this is a good olympus test for
when you're out of the night yeah it
might be over
wait sorry dude also meaning a chick to
this [ __ ] just like staring at me
like what are you doing
a party
that's the song that's already playing
on your head when you're over stimulated
on drugs yes like when you did too much
adderall if someone was like what's the
inside of your head like it would be
that song yes
it's it's just so twisted i love it
dude that's amazing i didn't even get to
the part where he says
get out of your
mind which is
the name of the song
um
shout out to
big nasty caleb
he's the biggest little john fan i know
uh and he would always be the one to put
that on and it's just
it's so much like you guys said you're
just so over stimulated it's so fun
um and it's really stupid i mean lasers
and whistles you hear a laser or a
whistle in a song yeah all right should
we get into some honorable mentions
do we each one give you five
yeah yeah yeah [ __ ] yeah maybe to clean
up the honorable mentions we'll each
give like three honorable mentions
yeah yeah let's just go around yeah
chris you want to go ahead
um i feel like oh man
three no you give four or five just
listen there's a lot of musical songs
that i like a lot you know what i mean
or like disney songs oh dude you got
like
like wait for it from hamilton
one day more les mis define gravity yeah
from wicked let it go for finding
gravity
dude define gravity gets me so [ __ ]
amped let it go from frozen
um all very good
uh
all hail the heartbreaker i spilled
canvas we cranked that so much
in high school and done went over the
high school boys meet up we put it on oh
my gosh it's like a six minute song
that like there's not really a chorus
that repeats but like that's right there
we're taking back sunday
that's right
i think taking back sunday works with
i think all hail the heartbreaker was
pretty
it was only being internally
i didn't get the high school boys enough
in my list so definitely wanted to put
that on as an honorable mention
uh
motorcycle drive-by by third eye blind
beautiful jumper too
a lot of thrabbed light socks and uh
yeah
i'll stop there
beautiful honorable mentions i would go
uh a song entitled stronger by a lot of
female artists um just you know that a
lot of them have their song entitled
stronger kelly clarkson
i think pink has one chris kanye has one
christian aguilera kanye has a story
that's like that's a good picture yeah
one's yeah that's a good one uh
we will rock okay two here that didn't
make my list and then i'll then it will
be someone else's turn i the tiger and
we will rock you oh i have the title i
have some of the best intros of all time
but then when you get to the actual song
you're kind of like it's a nice song but
i'm not pumped up anymore and how
contingent is the power of i have the
tiger to
the rocky
association massive that's where one
like i
they help each other but if you just if
you're just listening i of the attacker
like
by the time you get to the end of the
song
you know it's like it's the same way
with the tiger in me you're kind of like
all right dude what's up
it's like i love hearts on fire and
rocky for
when i'm watching rocky but i never put
on also you're the best from the karate
kid and that's another one
from teen wolf yes you're the best
yeah but like you don't everybody's ever
gonna kill i never put that song you
might but i've never seen it you need
her at the beginning saying you're the
best daniel yeah and then it's like i'm
watching karate at the same time that's
that's what the that's part of the
appeal of the song for sure you got a
lot of you know judas priests ac dc you
got back in black you got
i forget the judas priest
thunderstruck oh you already did that
but yeah a lot of these 80s what i will
say to you about uh we will rock you is
it's a stadium pump up and then
thunderstruck has that tune yeah i'll
mention a couple of but that's very
important too like can this song lose
yourself can do that does this song work
for like 50 000 people at the same time
um and those ones certainly do
um i gotta go with uh you know
enter sandman i was thinking about
metallica i mean if you want to get into
metal you start with understand man it's
[ __ ]
and the slow build up
what a rift
um just often never
neverland okay
uh bring me to life by evan essence
great one great workout song oh man that
was really good
uh
you know i gotta go with my dog purple
disco machine in the dark oh yeah
cruel summer bananarama right what's in
the mood for summer reo speedwagon can't
fight this feeling yes that's always the
ones are good yeah i always imagine
proposing to that one i'm like i can't
fight this feeling
[Music]
keep on loving you too we'll get you
jacked up
glory of love by uh chicago i think
those are like 80s ballads that fire you
up to be romantic yes those are very
valuable a lot of journey songs peter
sotera yeah he didn't cover a lot of
jock jams too like the nba like you
started so you started with
that's a jock jam oh right yeah yeah
yeah
allen parsons project you have that with
the sugar space jam song van halen right
now
yeah oh van halen's all very good for
pumping john van halen
all mine are from when i'm like 15. it's
the same way my villains are from when
i'm nine yeah a lot of these are
specific to them so funny they're
developing internal affairs when you
were nine yeah it was a weird household
[Music]
do you have any other ones shot that's
that's
break stuff by limp biscuit yeah bro
like
biscuit on there yeah i mean
yes
all of imagine dragons yes yeah yes for
for uh stadium one seven nation army is
the standard that one works really
nicely
um
also from like movie scores uh pirates
of the caribbean is a good one to run
too
uh inception time will just make you
feel like a secret agent yes um bill
conte from rocky is yes obviously this
is the last parade in matrix oh yeah
a tremendous one to the stars from
dragon heart one of the most beautiful
songs of all time
oh what's one in blow
oh whoa oh black buddy
back in black ac dc uh dude remember the
name by fort miner dude yeah dude yeah
you're obviously trying to be the best
pump up song of all time yeah not enough
hey we'll just end up being the best
pump up it's a little too intentional
it's a little too on the nose but hey
man if you're putting together a
highlight tape with some football plays
that's a great one um num encore lincoln
park and uh jay-z
and then uh
and then a couple sex ones that i had to
leave off
but uh sex is on fire by kings of leon
yeah yeah always made me want to just
start grab someone's head and just
really connect and then uh
[Music]
and then uh what was my other sex one oh
this is very specific to me and it was
tough to leave off the list but uh
alive with the power and glory of love
by saying anything yeah yeah because the
theme is it's about a jewish guy and his
gal the nazis are coming to take them
away or kill them and what do they
decide to do in the face of that bone in
the living room that's what that song is
yeah
it's a great song you never knew that no
it's just about [ __ ] when the nazis
are coming i had no idea great you know
i love period piece which is the
ultimate rebellion to
to you know cruelty is love let's make
love it's boldline trio god called in
sick today it's pretty sick that's a afi
oh yeah if i [ __ ] i'm an idiot but yeah
they got some good ones it's got a
couple of bangers dude yeah yeah afi's

you know you can run it run it
can't fight this feeling by justin
timberlake that pumps people up at
weddings wedding pump up songs sometimes
they're too safe it's just like yeah i
like senorita i would prefer like a
crazy in love by beyonce oh yeah

unfortunately yeah
i think cute i don't like taking back
sunday at all
uh hey music is subjective and uh
if you're gonna go garth brooks as a
pump up song i think you gotta go
friends in low places
that gives you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah i got it
yeah that's true because everyone can
sing it together it's like when you're
right you're right thank you right i
love you i love you guys hey a lot of
great lists
uh
hey zooming on my eyes right now because
i've never been so needy
ah did any of you guys have a sharp
object or uh
rope in my car can anyone put the last
resort on me okay
[Laughter]
last resort's fun because you're killing
yourself but you're pumped up
killing yourself loudly
yeah
uh three i think
it's a it's a good number one it's
number two i'd never heard before
three i actually heard during my
championship softball game
four never heard and five i'm like
i think i got jt
i've never heard till i collapse before
what
what
yeah sorry guys
yeah i never heard it
really yeah wow for your number two it
should be something
everyone knows i feel like everyone
knows that one right well if it's just
me it's just me but that
i didn't put me in charge here i could
i'd give this job away in heartbeat
uh don't say that
you don't like being the judge
it's a lot of pressure certainly
especially when everyone's you're one
man dude with boxing fights they have
three of them and and joe rogan thinks
that's not enough he thinks there should
be five or seven
but aaron
you're the judge dog heavy is the head
that where's the decision
[Music]
yeah so we're down to chad or chris
and
ultimately what it's coming down to for
me is
the number one pick
being better than the other number one
pick what were you guys number one picks
real quick we got chad lose yourself by
eminem and
one uh chris zombie by the cranberry
well there's no better that's what we
know now yeah yeah i i'm going with chad
first chad where'd it go
you
if i could turn back time could have
come fifth
but everything else just bangs that's
what i thought
about his list yeah calling me was a
great if you curveball pitch
and then did you lose
and then a higher by creed
yeah oh yeah we had a good list and i
think i think chris if you'd go on
chandelier one zombie two maybe i think
is better
value yeah i think two in a row i know
yeah i know it's it's tough that's a
good point that's a good point also if
you picked chris to win three times in a
row it's like you guys need to guess
would be here together all right
you guys taking it did that worry you
picking my brother so many times that
people would have started accusing you
of like maybe a favoritism or a
relationship outside the draft that's
going on
or even that or just like a a crazy
star-crossed like
synergy yeah you guys are just
bros of the same ilk
yeah i don't i don't hate any song on
your list that's for sure and i don't i
certainly don't on chad's but
uh
i and i will say about chad's list when
he picked call on me
because i didn't even think about that
and then when he said it and i literally
felt myself
get aroused that's a three it that's a
three on your list and it's like the
most animalistic
[ __ ] horny song ever yeah and just
that music video started playing in my
head and i was just like i was in a good
place yeah yeah it's nice
chat way to go babies thanks guys jt3
strider iv good [ __ ] man
thanks
um
all right
what up council i'm high as a giraffe
right now so like it may have [ __ ] up
big time while supporting my dank ass
wife's pregnancy and prepping for this
huge life transfer mage and to be the
best dead i can be i've been pumping
audio straight at my wife's ute to try
and instill the baby with true wisdom
and prevent them from being a shmole
that was all fun and games till after a
full trimester of the only thing my son
had heard has been this pod
yep that's right and now whenever i
stream the youtube clips while changing
the weed lads nappies my son reaches
toward the screen saying data i think he
thinks chad is his dad
that or his first word is about to be
dank what do i do here bros seems like
he could be a really cool guy one day
but the thought of not having my son
recognize me as a father figure haunts
me
do i keep raising him or should i just
quit while i'm ahead and let e-boys take
over
chad do you and kennedy still want a dog
the little dude so far is great on all
fours and isn't totally locked in a name
so it might be a real catch sorry for
the wrong long email [ __ ] pusio shut up
brody jabwell i late
really good email wow
a huge honor thank you
um
i'd be open to accepting your child
uh if you want to you know
send him be a stork um would you be
accepting the child as a person or as a
dog as a dog
uh we have a little fluff bed and
you know we have a bowl and we have a
dish
and uh get a kennel too you don't want
the thing just running around yeah is it
called trained i'd like to know that for
sure
great
um and uh
do i need to find a nice bush
for pee or
you know tell me you know the specifics
on your dog child
and uh i may accept so thank you
what do you guys think
um
yeah i think you guys you should adopt
his kid yeah
i think you should invest in some air
pods but
i like having the string on him
dude or do that
legit you can do a lot of things
all right going deep what's up boys
there's this girl in my friend group
who's got an insane body i want to shoot
my shot but i don't want to mess up the
friendship
also there's this girl who's friends
with her that i was working on at a
party who said she hopes to see me again
soon
which girl should i go for thanks guys
this guy's the best dude dude i don't
know
dude that's such a tough call bro i mean
the one girl's got an insane body but
the other girl like you guys reviving at
a party
dude that's a crazy tossing because
here's the thing dude the second girl
who said showed a little bit of interest
in you like that could probably tur like
odds are you're gonna be busting a nut
with her sooner and they already got
energy dude they got energy but the girl
with the insane body how do you pass
that up and you're a guy who likes to
win and compete
so i think what you got to do is compete
and go after the girl with the insane
body honestly get one of your boys
interested in her too so you can [ __ ]
dominate him dude i hear you bro this
dude should straight up dominate and
he's got that kind of potential which
needs to be fostered for sure
and i want to see him being top dog but
bro how do you pass up on energy dude
that's true because an insane bod if
it's not animated by some real connect
is gonna feel inert dude so guys
he should just hook up with both of them
figure that out
oh i can't choose i don't know what to
do choose both it's like [ __ ] it's like
a trick question but there's no
consequences dude it's just all bonus if
you hit that both bro if you do it right
how are they even gonna be mad exactly
bro wait
bro wait though bro
bro wait
do you go for both dude which is for
sure
or do you try and lock in both same time
that's a good call by you same time's a
good call because he's trying to get
that bmx sponsorship so
just [ __ ] if you hook up with them
both at the same time that's just more
efficient gives you more time to
practice
broadly on advice though stay lit dude
that's true for sure just hey stay lit
and keep being a king king yeah
don't ever write in something like that
again dude
don't ever [ __ ] write something like
that again to us dude
someone's got real problems dude do you
know what i like about that whole thing
though never do that it feels like it
took him 10 seconds to write that email
yeah
he didn't use any other thing her finger
about his thumbs yeah he usually left it
on his phone he's like you know what
dude i'll check in with chad and jt real
quick see what the homies say all right
later dude next time you're partying
whichever one's closer there you go yeah
dude pull over for that one exactly dude
i got nothing else to distinguish these
people i want real stakes what's your
biggest mistake who have you heard what
has your dad done wrong have you ever
done a hit and run what's going on dude
okay so this dude i can't find his
question but i remember him writing it
in
um
he said that his ish is that
is that his
his girlfriend has the same name as his
mom
and it weirds him out when he's talking
to her especially in intimate settings
okay so what's the sich dude does he
call his mom by her name he calls his
mom
because i call mom mom that
i guess yeah
i mean i guess i guess yeah i'd be a
little weird but
is it like a deal br like
i don't think it would be a deal breaker
but i guess i never dealt with it also
who do you really
once you get past like the four month
mark don't you just call your girlfriend
by like like pet names exactly yeah like
it's weird to still be calling your
girlfriend like donna yeah unless you're
trying to get her attention her name is
babe or sexy little vixen
yeah yes we've gone boo from like that's
from the get-go or like challenger you
know yeah feisty beast yeah you know
phoenix
i call mine creamsicle there it is dude
yeah i think you so either tigress but
if you don't feel comfortable with that
just keep calling your girlfriend by her
name and call your mom by a pet name
yeah yeah dude
what are you yeah
yeah call your mom babe be like babe
babe make me a grilled cheese cause
you're my mommy and my mom hey boo
boo boo
hey sexy sexy what's up you need me to
grab something from the front yeah i got
you girl
hey babe can you help me with rat
hey candy pants

all right chad who's your beef of the
week
uh i you know this is our fourth pod
this week because we're banking them so
it's tough for me to come up with a beef
i know that's tough so i asked my mom
i'm like mom what is your beef right now
my mom's beef is how expensive is
expensive it is to go on vacation right
now
oh she's in the flesh yeah we're trying
to we're trying to go on a cruise we're
trying to you know get tropical stay tan
winter's coming you know august
you better get your [ __ ] together else
you're gonna be pasty so she's trying to
get those trips lined up and she's like
it's expensive and it's and she's like
it's pretty effed
so i was like i freaking hear you
squirtle
and uh
yeah
dude my beef is
for aaron aaron
you expressed some beef earlier that you
had that i want to toss it to you
it was the [ __ ] uh yeah what was it
again no my beauty is not with aaron i
love aaron
what did someone do to you they [ __ ]
up dude
why can't i remember this
all right must not have been that
important do my beef is with my brain
for not being able to remember right now
this is your third podcast in three days
too that's true and look here's the
thing i'm we're chill bro it's like i
have that much beef dude but someone
[ __ ] with aaron hard dude and it was
messed up dude
it wasn't about going over laurel canyon
wasn't your mcdonald's it wasn't
oh [ __ ] i'll remember in a second dude
when we were we were both here we both
and we were all like that's [ __ ] up
dude that someone did that
wait was i here for that yeah we were
always right out in the kitchen we're
like that's [ __ ] up dude i'm on modelo
time man
dude that's crazy maybe we got it all
out maybe we kind of like it's cathartic
yeah all right well that's chill that
shit's been done whatever [ __ ] was
messing with aaron earlier did that's my
beef dude
thank you to the universe for quelling
it chris what's your view for the week
i'd be is myself for downloading this
tower defense game on my phone
that has totally sucked up my life for
the last day and a half where i haven't
looked up from my phone at all
and i've barely had a conversation with
my wife since then because i'm just so
locked in
i'm really addicted but you know i hope
i get over it soon because i it's uh
it's [ __ ] with my [ __ ] what's it
called tower defense is that like
commanding
i didn't even know which one i picked i
just searched tower defense in the app
store you know where you just have waves
of
troops coming in
and you just build [ __ ]
and i've been so locked in i've just
been glued to my phone for like two days
nice dude my beef of the week is with
guys with weird vibes
nice dude you know and like a lot of
these guys have like tons of friends and
are very social and are ostensibly cool
by most metrics but then they just
cruise in you're like dude
like either chill or like get it
together but
i can't handle you in this weird
in-between it's just throwing me and so
like much love to all people we're all
doing our best but guys with weird vibes
like
it just kind of
puts a big burden on you and i'm trying
to chill
no it changes the way you sit because
they'll come up and they'll sit next to
you and you're just like
they know who they are right like they
know that they're doing this i don't
know no they usually you know what makes
their vibes weird too is that they don't
take ownership and they fling it back at
you they're always the first dude to be
like hey what's wrong with you why are
you acting weird you're like i'm being
like normal dude or like if i am being
weird it's not worth commenting on and
then what you just like
i'm like take responsibility for your
side of things dude for sure dude one
dude yesterday we were sitting
it was me and a comedian and there was
only room for the two of us and then he
rolled up and was like yo can i sit
there too i was like we're all gonna be
like squished together i'm not even good
friends with this comedian i was like
dude it was painful but i had to
literally but you can't sit here
yeah get on you though but you don't
ever want to have to say that you know
so [ __ ] that guy for putting me in that
spot that's why dude all right babe
slash legend chad
uh this is uh for my mom too the legend
slash babe is a dog that was lost for
four years and returned back to its
family oh my god for four years
that's amazing i don't have any deets
it's something it's just that alone i'm
like that's can you imagine just being
like
a spot
you're just like what up dude you said
it and i had a picture in my head of
rick yeah a family getting reunited yeah
it was already tearing up it's amazing
did they find the dog because it got
like coveted vast and the government was
able to find where it was finally yeah
that's yeah that's why i figured yeah
yeah yeah
around yeah yeah it's like find your dog
modern app [ __ ] yeah bill gates emailed
them and was like hey i know we're
[ __ ] yeah he's like hey are you
looking for
yeah dude rusty i know what right yeah
exactly bro it's so weird you just said
rusty they don't wanna you guys said
that no dude that's the energy because
my my babe slash legend of the week
me and my dad guys fiance were elming
today
and she showed me the color rust dude
we might get a rust bed spread and i
really liked it dude so is it like
maroon but like a little bit more
exactly i actually referenced your couch
i was like you have a great couch thank
you
love that couch can't wait to watch
[ __ ] ball on that this fall it's
coming and
she was like hey look at this bed spread
it's rust and i was like holy [ __ ] did i
like the color rust
so she's just opening my mind to new
things so i guess
rust but really what rust means like the
subtext to that is like [ __ ] new
experiences and and [ __ ] legit taste you
know
hell yeah yeah
chris who's your b uh chris who's your
babe slash legend
uh this couple that i saw at uh the
brandy carlisle concert that i went to a
month ago
where the female in the relationship
was like
seven inches taller than the dude whoa
she has really broad shoulders
and he was a skinny dude
and they were
they were on the stairs like get even
closer to the action and they were
rocking out they knew a bunch of the
songs and then when it went to like a
power ballad
she freaking
held him in her arms like
snuggling him and they were just rocking
and he didn't and just to see like that
size shift and they were not embarrassed
at all i was like this is [ __ ] i
don't know it's legendary dude it was
amazing did she ever get in a nice squat
stance and allow him to shimmy up her
body onto her shoulders during the time
no because they were
it was a ele like it was an elevated
section and they were right on the edge
okay that would have been
way too dangerous
if they were on the floor in that ga
section i imagine
he would have been going up on her
shoulder for sure
um because she was built
[ __ ] yeah
dude i think i found out who the coolest
white guy of all time is i'm biased too
because this has been my trajectory
recently in terms of the
info i've been absorbing i'm going jfk
oh he's a world war ii hero he's
courageous he gets ass he's inspiring he
seems very comfortable in his skin
and it seems like he can make the room
been to him
more than the other side so i'm going
jfk is the coolest white guy ever that's
pretty nice i like that obvious
sinatra's cool i'm an elvis guy over
sinatra but you know i have trouble
going
we were talking about this earlier i
i probably put athletes and world
leaders above
musicians musicians are above actors for
sure 100 but i still put
for me athletes and
and world leaders are still have the
highest
ceiling they move different
singers move different too though actors
don't move that good mick jagger is
pretty cool
yeah mick jagger is cool
obviously it's sad how freddie mercury
he got assassinated but it is nice that
there's not like a
twilight end of his life where he could
[ __ ] things up dude it's such a good
point
it's a little too pocky yeah where it's
like we saw the best of them and we
never saw them get watered down so it's
like through ages you almost wish
long enough you know well the nice part
about athletes is you only remember them
for their prime like i don't really
count against michael jordan
being a bad owner yeah and i don't
really kind of like making bad
free agent decisions playing for the
wizards you're like whatever thank you
thank you for that
um
all right chad what's your quote of the
week my quote of the week comes from
higher by creed the great call
can you take
me higher
to a place where blind men see
can you take me higher
to a place with golden streets
uh mine is [ __ ] you i won't do what you
tell me right from uh rage against the
machine
minus mine's from out of your minds
this is gonna be my quote and my phrase
will be forgetting after it

a little long i don't give a [ __ ] i
don't give a [ __ ] [ __ ] it i don't give a
[ __ ] i don't give a [ __ ] [ __ ] it i don't
give a [ __ ] i don't give a [ __ ] [ __ ] it
i don't give a [ __ ] [ __ ] it
let's [ __ ] lose it
get out of your mind
that's beautiful dude
how do you [ __ ] beautiful dude
do you think they read the lyrics he
like really just gave it to his boy and
he started tearing up he was all
precious about it he's like look there's
nine i don't give a [ __ ] here we can't
have ten
it's just an artistic number nine or is
eleven or nine if anything i think came
in was like what if we tripled it yeah
exactly yeah

yeah i like to [ __ ] i got a [ __ ]
problem
i love bad [ __ ] that's my [ __ ]
problem and yeah i like to [ __ ] i got a
[ __ ] problem
and then he puts a nice capstone and he
says
if finding somebody real is your [ __ ]
problem
bring a girl to the crib maybe we can
solve them
that's amazing
dude you know what you know what i
wanted to say at the end of that though
